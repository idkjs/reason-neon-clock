  /* Here we use string concatination to pass in our calculated angles. This produces an output that looks like ```reason
     {transform: "rotate(82deg)"}
     ```
     when logged in the console. Not being strong in `css` I didn't realize that the `css` is expecting a string which we would get from changing the result of our calculation from an `int` or `float` to a string then attaching the `deg` to the end. I learned this in the usual way, by reading someone else's code. In this case, @persianturtles code [here](https://github.com/persianturtle/reason-app-shell-starter-kit/blob/dc43c75671c1d6959533df94033f8e93319facf4/src/App.re#L384-L397).
